## The Calm Before The Storm

[Earlier today](/blog/moviequest-the-birth-of-an-idea), we launched MovieQuest - a Tinder-style app for choosing movies with friends. The deployment went smooth. Vercel was happy. The app loaded beautifully on desktop.

We felt like heroes.

Then we actually tested it on our phones.

## "This Will Be Easy" - Famous Last Words

**Two hours after launch**, we pushed some nice UI improvements - streaming provider accordions, better genre logic, host name display. Polish. We were feeling confident.

Then we asked a friend to try the app.

*"The swipe doesn't work."*

Oh no.

## The Bug Fixing Marathon Begins

What followed was **16 commits in under 2 hours**. Grab your popcorn. 🍿

### Hour 1: "How Many Bugs Can One App Have?"

**30 minutes in:** "Fix 7 critical bugs found in production testing"

We didn't find one bug. We found SEVEN. Simultaneously.

**Bug #1: The Identity Crisis**
- Host's name showed as "Host" instead of their actual name
- Turns out we hardcoded it. Oops.

**Bug #2: The Hotel California Logo**
- You could enter the app, but you could never leave
- Logo wasn't clickable. No way to go back to homepage.
- Fixed: wrapped it in an `<a>` tag (should've been obvious)

**Bug #3: The Silent Trailers**
- Clicked "Watch Trailer" → nothing happened
- The function literally didn't exist yet
- We forgot to implement it. Classic.

**Bug #4: The Unreachable Buttons**
- Mobile poster so tall, you couldn't reach the swipe buttons
- Users scrolling desperately trying to find the buttons
- Solution: `max-height: 70vh` - why didn't we do this from the start?

**Bug #5: The Predictable "Random"**
- Random shuffle... that was identical for everyone
- Defeated the whole purpose
- Implemented proper seeded RNG with Fisher-Yates shuffle
- Now everyone sees the *same* random order (which is what we wanted)

**Bug #6: The Android Swipe-pocalypse**
- Android users: "Nothing happens when I swipe"
- iOS users: "Works fine for me"
- Welcome to mobile web development! 🙃
- Fixed with `touch-action: none` and Hammer.js timeout tweaks

**Bug #7: The Amnesia Bug**
- Refresh the page → back to movie #1
- Lost your progress completely
- Added localStorage position saving
- Your welcome message: saved positions

Seven bugs in one commit. We thought we were done.

*Narrator: They were not done.*

### Hour 1.5: The Alpine.js Debugging Spiral

**40 minutes later:** "Fix 4 critical issues from production testing"

Found four MORE bugs:
- Filters not applying
- Match threshold broken
- Vote counts wrong
- Member widget frozen

**Another 20 minutes:** "Fix critical bugs: swipe position, swipe gestures, and trailer discovery"

The swipe gestures STILL didn't work. We thought we fixed it.

*We did not fix it.*

**10 minutes later:** "Fix UX issues: swipe threshold, mobile layout, and host name"

Mobile layout still wonky. Swipe too sensitive. Could we get ANYTHING right?

**6 minutes later:** "Add debug logging for swipe gesture issues"

At this point: full panic mode. `console.log()` EVERYWHERE.

**2 minutes later:** "Fix swipe gestures - use `window.Alpine` instead of `Alpine`"

💡 EUREKA! Alpine.js scope issue!

**3 minutes later:** "Fix swipe gestures - access Alpine component via DOM instead of store"

💔 Nope. Still broken. Different approach.

**1 minute later:** "Fix keyboard shortcuts to also use DOM-based Alpine access"

Oh great, now keyboard shortcuts are broken because of our "fix."

At this point we're just breaking new things faster than we fix old things.

### Hour 2: The Mobile Layout Saga

We thought we were done. Then we looked at the app on mobile again.

**8 minutes later:** "Fix pagination bug and mobile layout for genre tags"

Genre tags wrapping like a Christmas present. Pagination completely broken.

**20 minutes later:** "Implement state snapshot for instant swipe position restoration"

Position saving worked but was slooooow. Nobody likes slow apps.

**16 minutes later:** "Test: Change poster to object-contain with gradient background"

Posters cropping people's faces off. Tried a gradient background. Looked cool!

**4 minutes later:** "Optimize spacing and increase poster size for better visibility"

Text cramped. More spacing. Bigger poster.

**6 minutes later:** "Fix mobile poster height to show movie info"

Wait, now poster is too big AGAIN. How is this still a problem?

**1 minute later:** "Increase text sizes on mobile for better readability"

While we're here, text too small. Make it bigger.

**4 minutes later:** "Drastically reduce mobile poster size and increase info visibility"

🔥 FINAL SOLUTION: Small poster. Big info section. Done.

## What We Learned (The Hard Way)

### 1. Chrome DevTools Mobile Emulation Is A Liar

The app looked PERFECT on desktop. On actual phones?

```
Expectation: ✨ Beautiful responsive design
Reality: 💀 Buttons off-screen, nothing works
```

**Lesson:** Always test on real devices. Your iPhone. Your friend's Android. That old tablet in the drawer.

### 2. Touch Gestures Are The Final Boss of Web Development

We tried 5 different approaches:
- ❌ Default touch events
- ❌ Touch-action: manipulation
- ❌ Touch-action: pan-y
- ❌ Hammer.js default config
- ✅ Touch-action: none + Hammer.js timeout 2000ms

Mobile web gestures will humble you.

### 3. Alpine.js Documentation: "Am I A Joke To You?"

Trying to access Alpine components:
- `Alpine.store()` - sometimes works
- `window.Alpine` - works... differently
- DOM-based access - finally works

The docs don't explain this. You just have to suffer.

### 4. Users Are Chaos Agents

We tested ourselves. Worked great.

Two real users found:
- 7 bugs in 10 minutes
- 4 more in the next 20 minutes
- Edge cases we never imagined

Users will break your app in ways you didn't know were possible.

### 5. Ship Fast, Fix Faster

16 commits in 2 hours = controlled chaos.

But every fix went live within minutes. Users saw improvements in real-time.

Better than "we'll fix it in next week's release."

## The Silver Linings

Despite the carnage, our stack held strong:

✅ **Vercel** - Deployed 16 times in 2 hours, zero downtime
✅ **Supabase** - Real-time features never hiccupped
✅ **TMDB API** - Fast, reliable, no issues
✅ **Alpine.js** - Once we understood it, actually great
✅ **Tailwind** - Rapid iteration saved us

The bugs were 100% our fault, not the tools.

## Midnight: Finally Stable

At midnight, we deployed the final fix.

MovieQuest was stable. Swipes worked on iOS and Android. Trailers played. Mobile layout looked decent.

**Final Stats:**
- ✅ 16 commits in ~2 hours
- ✅ 11 major bugs fixed
- ✅ 7 minor UX improvements
- ❌ 0 hours of sleep

Tomorrow: a complete responsive design overhaul (yes, more layout fixes).

For tonight: we ship.

Day two of Flutter development brought something special: MovieQuest found its visual identity.

## The Phoenix Rises

A good logo tells your story instantly. The old phoenix was nice, but it didn't scream "movies". We needed something better.

Enter the **phoenix filmreel logo**.

The phoenix now clutches a filmstrip in its talons, the turquoise reels glowing against orange and blue feathers. It's unmistakably MovieQuest - rebirth meets cinema. The logo works everywhere:

- **App icons** across Android, iOS, and web (40+ sizes generated automatically)
- **Home screen** with dual gold/turquoise glow effect
- **Favicons** that actually look good in browser tabs
- **PWA icons** with proper safe zones for maskable designs

We added two new accent colors to the theme:
- `accentTurquoise` (#4FD1C5) from the filmreel
- `accentGreen` (#68D391) from the phoenix's wing accents

The branding now feels cohesive. Professional. Ready for launch.

## Not That Genre

Here's a problem: you want action movies, but NOT superhero films. Or horror, but NOT gore. The old system? All or nothing.

**New system: three-state genre filtering**.

Tap a genre chip once: **yellow with checkmark** - include this genre
Tap it again: **red with strikethrough** - exclude this genre
Tap a third time: **gray** - don't care either way

Each state has haptic feedback and a subtle scale animation. It feels tactile, responsive, satisfying.

Behind the scenes:
- Included genres use TMDB's `with_genres` parameter
- Excluded genres use `without_genres` (completely filters them out)
- The ALLE/ÉÉN toggle only affects included genres
- Excluded genres are ALWAYS filtered regardless of match mode

So if you exclude Horror but include Action + Comedy with "ÉÉN" mode, you'll get action movies OR comedies, but never horror. The math works exactly how you'd expect.

And it's backward compatible - the database stores `excluded_genres` as an optional field, so old sessions still work fine.

## Going Live

While we were at it, we deployed MovieQuest to **Vercel** for web access.

Same Flutter codebase. Same Supabase backend. Now accessible from desktop browsers.

The build pipeline:
1. Generate web-specific environment config from Vercel env vars
2. Build Flutter web with release optimizations
3. Deploy to `movie-quests.vercel.app`
4. Auto-deploy on every push to main branch

We hit some snags (256-character command limits, asset requirements, font warnings), but eventually got it running smooth. The web version is now live and tracking analytics.

## Three Wins

In one day we:
1. **Established visual identity** with a logo that actually represents what we do
2. **Doubled filtering power** with genre exclusions (not just inclusions)
3. **Went multi-platform** with web deployment alongside mobile

The phoenix is rising. And it's holding a filmstrip.

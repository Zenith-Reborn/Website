## Sunday Morning: The Last Web App Fixes

[Yesterday](/blog/the-great-layout-overhaul), we finally got the responsive layout working. MovieQuest ran smoothly on every screen size.

This morning, we pushed two final commits to the web app:
- Fixed mobile swipe gestures (again)
- Removed conflicting touch-action rules

**8:49 AM:** Last commit to the web app repository.

The web version was done. Stable. Working. Deployed.

But something felt... incomplete.

## The Mobile App Dream

MovieQuest worked great as a website. You could:
- ✅ Open it in any browser
- ✅ Share via link (no downloads)
- ✅ Use on any device
- ✅ Update instantly (just refresh)

But there were limitations:
- ❌ No app icon on your home screen
- ❌ No offline functionality
- ❌ No push notifications
- ❌ Not in app stores
- ❌ Feels like a website, not an app

We wanted MovieQuest to feel **native**. Like a real app.

## The Decision

Flutter checked every box:
- 📱 iOS app
- 📱 Android app  
- 🌐 Web app
- 🖥️ Windows/Mac apps

All from **one Dart codebase**.

**Decision made: Flutter it is.**

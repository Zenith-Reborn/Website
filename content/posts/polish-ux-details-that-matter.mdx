Sometimes the best features are the ones users don't consciously notice. They just make everything feel... right.

## Shareable URLs That Don't Suck

Original join URLs looked like this:
```
https://movie-quests.vercel.app/#/?join=abc-123-xyz
```

Not exactly elegant. Hard to read. Impossible to remember. And that `#/?` combo? Yikes.

**New URLs:**
```
https://movie-quests.vercel.app/join/abc-123-xyz
```

Clean. Shareable. Professional. And they work everywhere - localhost, Vercel previews, production, future custom domains. The URL generation system automatically detects the environment and builds the right link.

Plus, the old URLs still work. We redirect `/?join=SESSION_ID` to the new format, so nobody's QR codes break.

## Preview Before You Leap

Imagine clicking a join link and getting instantly dumped into a movie session. No context. No warning. Just... movies.

Not great UX.

**Now when you open a join link:**
1. You see the **Session Preview Screen**
2. Host's name displayed prominently
3. Current member count
4. All active filters (streaming services, genres, age ratings)
5. Optional: add your own name
6. One-click join button

It answers the question: "What am I about to join?" before you commit.

The preview fetches session data plus host information in a single database call. Efficient. Fast. Informative.

## When Movie Titles Go Japanese

Here's a problem: TMDB has movies in every language. Some titles are in Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, Korean...

For Dutch/English users, seeing "劇場版「鬼滅の刃」" instead of "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train" is not ideal.

**Solution: Smart title fallback**

The app now detects when a title contains non-Latin characters (CJK, Arabic, Cyrillic, Thai, etc.) and automatically falls back to the original English title if available.

Examples:
- `劇場版「鬼滅の刃」` → Shows "Demon Slayer: Mugen Train"
- `Squid Game` → Shows "Squid Game" (already readable)
- `オッペンハイマー` → Shows "Oppenheimer"

Zero manual configuration. No extra API calls. Just automatic detection using Unicode character ranges.

The full movie library stays intact (anime and K-dramas don't get removed), but titles are always readable for Western audiences.

## Colorful Identities

Partial matches show which members have already voted. Originally? Just text names.

Boring. Forgettable. Wasted opportunity.

**Now: Colorful avatar circles with initials**

Each member gets:
- A **2-letter initial** (Hans Weebers → HW, Hans → HA)
- A **deterministic color** from a 10-color palette (same name = same color always)
- A **circular avatar** (20px) that's instantly recognizable

When 4+ members vote, we show the first 3 avatars plus "+2" overflow indicator.

Result? Partial match cards have personality. You can spot your friends at a glance. The UI feels alive.

## The Devil in the Details

These features aren't flashy. No one's going to screenshot the URL structure and post it on Instagram.

But they matter:
- **Clean URLs** make sharing effortless
- **Session previews** reduce confusion
- **Smart titles** keep everything readable
- **Colorful avatars** add personality

This is what separates a prototype from a product. The little polish. The attention to detail. The care.

MovieQuest is starting to feel real.

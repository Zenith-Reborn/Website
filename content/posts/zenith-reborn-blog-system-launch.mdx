# Zenith Reborn Blog System - From Idea to Production

Today we built something special: a fully automated blog system that seamlessly integrates with our development workflow. From the first idea to live deployment - everything now works automatically.

## üéØ What Did We Build?

### Blog Infrastructure

A complete blog solution with:

- **MDX Support** - Markdown with React components
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Beautiful code snippets in blog posts
- **Dark Theme** - Perfectly matching the main website
- **Filtering & Search** - Filter by project (SkillQuest, ZenFocus, etc.) and tags
- **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on desktop and mobile

### Automatic Blog Generation

The unique aspect of this system is the full automation:

```bash
# In a project directory
/write-blog-post
```

That's it! Claude Code:
1. Analyzes git commits from the last week
2. Generates a professional blog post in English
3. Saves the post as an MDX file
4. Commits and pushes to GitHub
5. Vercel deploys automatically

**No more manual steps!**

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack

- **Next.js 15** - React framework with App Router
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development

### Blog Components

We built custom components for each part:

**BlogCard Component**
```typescript
// Shows blog posts with project-specific colors
const projectColors = {
  SkillQuest: { badge: 'bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-600 to-blue-500' },
  ZenFocus: { badge: 'bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-purple-500' },
  'Zenith Reborn': { badge: 'bg-phoenix-gradient' }
}
```

Each project gets its own visual identity with gradients and glow effects.

**BlogFilter Component**
- Real-time search through posts
- Filter by project name
- Filter by tags
- Active filters are clearly visible

**MDXComponents**
- Custom styling for all markdown elements
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Responsive images
- Beautiful blockquotes and tables

### MCP Server Integration

The automation is powered by a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server:

**Functions:**
- `analyze_project_changes` - Git history analysis
- `generate_blog_post` - MDX generation with frontmatter
- `save_blog_post` - Save to content directory
- `list_blog_posts` - Overview of all posts

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.13
- GitPython for repository analysis
- MCP SDK for Claude Code integration

## üé® Design Choices

### Dark Theme

The blog uses the same dark theme as the main website:

- Background: `#0F0F0F` (deep black)
- Primary colors: Gold, orange, red (Phoenix gradient)
- Accents: Semi-transparent cards with colored borders
- Text: Light colors for optimal readability

### Navigation

An important design principle: **you're never stuck**.

On every page you can:
- Click on logo ‚Üí Back to homepage
- Click on "Blog" ‚Üí To blog overview
- Click on section links ‚Üí Directly to that section (even from blog)

Smooth scrolling ensures a premium user experience.

## üöÄ Deployment Pipeline

### Git Workflow

Fully automated with Personal Access Token:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "New blog post"
git push  # Happens automatically!
```

### Vercel Integration

Push to GitHub ‚Üí Vercel detects change ‚Üí Builds automatically ‚Üí Deployed!

**Build time:** ~2 minutes
**Uptime:** 99.9%
**Global CDN:** Instant worldwide

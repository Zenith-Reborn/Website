- **Behind the scenes**: A look into our development process

## Why this blog?

We believe in transparency and want to take our users along on the journey of building great apps. By sharing weekly updates, you get:

1. **Insight** into what's happening behind the scenes
2. **Early access** to information about new features
3. **Opportunity** to give feedback during development
4. **Community building** through shared growth

## How often do we post?

Our goal is to publish a new blog post **weekly**, summarizing:

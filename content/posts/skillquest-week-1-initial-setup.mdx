# SkillQuest Week 1 - Project Setup & Architecture

This week I started development on **SkillQuest**, the skill tracking app that helps users master their skills.

## What happened?

### Project Setup

The foundation has been laid for the Android app:

- **Kotlin** as the primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose** for the UI
- **Room Database** for local data storage
- **MVVM architecture** for clean code separation

### Architecture Decisions

After research, I chose a **single-activity architecture** with Compose Navigation. This gives us:

1. Faster navigation between screens
2. Better state management
3. Less memory overhead
4. Modern Android development pattern

### Database Schema

The initial database schema has been set up for:

```kotlin
// Skill entity
@Entity(tableName = "skills")
data class Skill(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
    val id: Long = 0,
    val name: String,
    val category: String,
    val targetHours: Int,
    val currentHours: Float = 0f,
    val createdAt: Long = System.currentTimeMillis()
)

// Focus session entity
@Entity(tableName = "focus_sessions")
data class FocusSession(
    @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)
    val id: Long = 0,
    val skillId: Long,
    val duration: Long,
    val startTime: Long,
    val endTime: Long,
    val notes: String? = null
)
```

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Database Migrations

Room Database migrations can be complex. I learned to have a good migration strategy from the start.

**Solution**: Use `fallbackToDestructiveMigration()` during development, and implement proper migrations later for production.

### Challenge 2: Compose State Management

State management in Compose is different from traditional Android development.

**Solution**: Use `ViewModel` with `StateFlow` for reactive updates to the UI.

## Next Week

Planning for week 2:

- [ ] Implement skill creation screen
- [ ] Build skill list overview
- [ ] Focus timer basic functionality
- [ ] Statistics tracking setup

Stay tuned for more updates!
